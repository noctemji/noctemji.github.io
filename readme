This change brings updated HTML files as well as Dark / light mode!

At this point this does not save in the browser, so it will revert back to dark mode when you travel through the pages.

In the next push I will have the browser save the users preference so that when you swtich to light mode or dark mode it carries over as you switch pages.

Thank you! - CH
